// Find my Seat (4-8)
//  * 
//  * Write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.
//  * The first row-seat combination should be 0-0 
//  * The last row-seat combination will be 25-99
//  * 
//  * Things to note: 
//  *  - the row and seat numbers start at 0, not 1
//  *  - the highest seat number is 99, not 100
